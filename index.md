Things I Get Excited About
==========================

- Making it easy to write programs. Computers are taking over the world: therefore, being able to tell them what to do is incredibly powerful, and should be made as easy as possible.

- Communicating effectively, especially in teaching.

- Forming correct beliefs. [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality][hpmor] has improved my mind more than anything else in the world, except my closest friends and relatives.

Things I've Done
================

- I wrote <a href="https://github.com/speezepearson/browsergui">a super-simple, super-portable GUI library for Python</a>. It has no dependencies (other than Python 2.7 or later), and uses a browser as a front-end, thereby not requiring Qt or wxWidgets or PyObjC or any other low-level libraries that will flood you with abstruse error messages when you try to install them. It has run out-of-the-box on every system I've tried it on.

- I graduated from UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Physics and CS. I got accepted to U.Washington, where I now work with [Michael Ernst][mernst] on software-engineering-type stuff. This includes some fault localization (see Section III [here](/compsci/research/2016/03/20/automated-debugging.html) for a brief overview; paper forthcoming), and a little bit of abstract type inference (in progress).
