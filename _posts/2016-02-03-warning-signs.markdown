About a year ago, I stumbled across a book. It's fiction (though it does occasionally reference real-world events), but its main purpose isn't to tell a story: it's to instruct and enlighten, and, through a series of morality tales, to teach you how to live the Right Way.

This book had an immense effect on me. Its morals just feel *right*, and its lessons have changed the way I look at the world: they explain so much of what I see and reveal new patterns to me. I used to think sinful-but-viscerally-appealing thoughts fairly often (much less than most people, I think, but still often); I didn't notice when I was doing it, and even if I had noticed, I wouldn't have found anything wrong with it. But the book trained me to catch myself in the act, banish the Bad Thoughts even though they feel good, and hopefully live a happier and more moral life as a result.

I've started attending a sort of book club. Every week, there's some assigned reading -- sometimes from the book, but usually from more recent writings that come out of the same intellectual tradition -- and then we get together to share our thoughts. I think there are lots of these book clubs scattered throughout the world, usually reading essays from a handful of prolific scholars who are highly-esteemed throughout this community.

A lot of the people in my book club voluntarily give up 10% of their earnings, generally in ways recommended by said esteemed scholars. I don't, yet. There's not a *strong* pressure for everybody to pay this tithe, but I think there's a general feeling that it's a worthy act that makes you a better person.

Anyway, I really like this community and the people in it, and I'm going to try to get more involved despite all these <strong style="color:red">HUGE FLASHING WARNING SIGNS</strong>.

I *hope* I never look back on this post as a huge I-told-you-so from Past Spencer.
