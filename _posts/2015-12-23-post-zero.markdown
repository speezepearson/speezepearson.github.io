Well, bad blog posts are better than no blog posts!

With that as my call to arms, I started using [Beeminder][beeminder] to encourage me to write some. Beeminder is a service with a delightfully straightforward business model: you set goals, you report progress to Beeminder, and if you achieve your goals, the service is free!

If you don't, they take your money.

I love the ideas the Internet comes up with.

I discovered Beeminder through [Star Slate Codex][ssc], my new favorite blog. It says good things about my tribe, and bad things about the other tribes, which is great, and obviously the author is wildly insightful.
